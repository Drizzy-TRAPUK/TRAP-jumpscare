-- QBCORE! 
--THIS IS JUST A TEST THERE IS A FEW BUS THAT I AM AWARE OF 
-- FIRST BUG IS ONCE THE SCARE HAS FINISHED IT FREEZES YOUR SCREEN AND YOU HAVE TO ensure TRAP-jumpscare IN YOUR F8 TO UNFREEZE
-- SECOND BUG IS WHEN THIS IS IN YOUR RESOURCE YOUR SCREEN GETS SLIGHTLY DARKER
-- 3RD ISNT A BUG I JUST HAVENT TESTED IT I DONT KNOW IF EVERYONE CAN DO THE t/jumpscare OR ONLY ADMINS
-- THIS WAS ONLY MADE FOR A LAUGH BUT IF YOU KNOW HOW TO FIX AND YOU WANT TO DEBUG IT FEEL FREE TO DO SO AND SEND IT BACK SO MORE PEOPLE HAVE THE DEBUGED VERSION
